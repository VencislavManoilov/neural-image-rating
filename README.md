# üöÄ Final Public Release ‚Äî Revolutionary AI Content Recommendation System

Welcome to the last public version of this repository.  
This project represents the early open-stage of a cutting-edge AI content recommendation system ‚Äî a technology with the potential to reshape how personalized content is discovered and consumed.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Development Notice

As of now, **further development of this project has been moved to a private repository**.

Due to the sensitive and innovative nature of this technology, all ongoing work, including source code, algorithms, architecture, and documentation, will remain private while we explore business opportunities and seek legal protection (licensing, patents, etc.).

## ‚ùó Why This Is Closed

The core concept behind this system is in a **vulnerable pre-patent stage**. To protect the integrity and originality of the idea, we have chosen to limit public disclosure until we secure the proper safeguards.

## ü§ù Future Plans

We plan to launch this as part of a larger product under a startup initiative. If you're interested in collaboration, investment, or partnership, feel free to reach out via email **vencislav@manoilov.email**.
